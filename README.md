## Immich & Node version support

Immich itself is in rapid development and there are occasional [breaking changes](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions?discussions_q=label%3Abreaking-change+sort%3Adate_created). For now, the support target of this project is integration with an endpoint running `ghcr.io/immich-app/immich-server:release`.

E2E test against an Immich instance requires setting these variables, then running `npm test`.
