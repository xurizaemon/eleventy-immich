# Eleventy ü§ù Immich

Shortcodes and integration to embed Immich media in Eleventy blogs.

## Status

Initial WIP. Contribution is welcome!

See https://chris.bur.gs/eleventy-immich/ for an introduction.

Support T&C: [no commitment, only commits](https://unmaintained.tech/)

## Immich & Node version support

Immich itself is in rapid development and there are occasional [breaking changes](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions?discussions_q=label%3Abreaking-change+sort%3Adate_created). For now, the support target of this project is integration with an endpoint running `ghcr.io/immich-app/immich-server:release`.

Tests are executed against a private instance.
